## Abstract

This project investigates the factors influencing mental health among students using a dataset comprising various demographic and psychological variables. By analyzing the data, the aim is to identify patterns and correlations that could inform better mental health support strategies in educational institutions.

## Keywords

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, especially among students who face unique stressors related to academic pressures, social dynamics, and personal development. This project aims to explore the factors that influence mental health in students, addressing the following research questions:

What demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) are most strongly associated with student mental health outcomes?
How do academic pressures (e.g., workload, performance expectations) impact student mental health?
What role do social factors (e.g., peer relationships, family support) play in the mental health of students?
These questions are motivated by the growing concern over rising mental health issues among students

2. Related Work  

> Describe your topic and related work in this space. You must include 3 citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ) Please use a standard citation style of your choice. (at least 200 words)

Research on student mental health has been extensive, highlighting various factors that contribute to psychological well-being. A study by Beiter et al. (2015) found that academic pressures and financial stress are significant predictors of mental health issues among students . Similarly, the work of Eisenberg et al. (2007) emphasizes the role of social support and its positive impact on student mental health . 
Another relevant study by Stallman (2010) explores the prevalence of mental health problems in the student population, providing a comprehensive overview of the mental health landscape in higher education . These studies collectively underscore the multifaceted nature of student mental health and the necessity for holistic approaches to support.


3. The Dataset

> Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/code/shariful07/student-mental-health-data-analysis/input
> Who collected the data?

The dataset was collected and compiled by MD SHARIFUL ISLAM

> How was the data collected or generated?  

The data was collected through surveys conducted in various educational institutions.
> Why was the data collected?  

The data was collected to monitor and study the prevalence of various mental health disorders globally, helping to identify trends, support public health policies, and prioritize healthcare initiatives.

>How many observations (rows) are in your data?  

There are 100 rows

> How many features (columns) are in the data?  

There are 10 columns

> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  

Working with mental health data involves significant ethical considerations. Ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of the participants is paramount to prevent any potential harm.
> What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

The dataset may not be representative of all student populations, as it could be skewed towards specific demographics or institutions. 
4. Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

Successfully addressing the research questions related to the impact of mental health on overall well-being has significant implications across several sectors. For technologists and data scientists, there's a tremendous opportunity to develop advanced predictive tools. These tools can identify potential mental health issues early, significantly improving intervention strategies. Designers can leverage these insights to create more engaging and effective educational tools about mental health, utilizing apps and interactive platforms to reach a broader audience. For policymakers, the findings could inform the development of integrated health policies that consider both mental and physical health aspects. Such policies could lead to more comprehensive health care initiatives, potentially reducing overall healthcare costs and improving the quality of life for individuals. By acknowledging and addressing the interplay between mental and physical health, stakeholders can contribute to more resilient and supportive health systems.

5. Limitations & Challenges
>What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)

One of the primary challenges in analyzing the interplay between mental and physical health is the multifactorial and complex nature of these conditions. Accurately modeling these nuanced relationships demands sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques, which can handle large datasets and diverse variables. Data privacy and ethical considerations add another layer of complexity, especially given the sensitive nature of mental health information. Ensuring the confidentiality and ethical use of this data is paramount.
Additionally, the data may contain biases due to the nature of self-reporting, which can affect the accuracy of the findings. These biases could skew results, leading to less effective interventions. Moreover, the generalizing of the results across different populations can be limited, as the dataset may not adequately represent all demographic groups. Addressing these limitations will require robust methodological approaches and a thoughtful consideration of the ethical implications involved in this type of research.
